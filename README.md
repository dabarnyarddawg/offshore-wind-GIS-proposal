<i>Abstract:<br>
As the United States expands its carbon-free electricity generation, the country has built considerable amounts of onshore wind power, but has left offshore opportunities largely undeveloped. In fact, as the end of 2016, the U.S. had total wind generating capacity of 81.2 gigawatts (GW) . The 30 megawatt (MW) Block Island Wind Farm  was the country’s singular offshore wind project, accounting for less than a tenth of one percent of the total capacity.<br>
Offshore wind provides several key advantages over onshore wind. First, and perhaps most obviously, there are vast amounts of open space in the ocean on which to build wind turbines (though care must still be taking in selecting the correct location, as this paper will discuss). Second, the wind over the ocean blows harder, and more consistently than on land . Finally, 53% of the United States’ population lives near the coasts1, so concentrating energy production near these population centers shortens the distance needed to transport energy from its source.<br>
This paper will describe a methodology for selecting the best location for an offshore wind farm off of the Virginia coast by considering the physical site characteristics, wind speeds, available federal lease parcels, distance to transmission interconnections and ports, and unsuitable areas that must be avoided.<br></i>
